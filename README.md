# schedRec

This is a simple python script that helps automate scheduled recordings of your screen.
This script gets a link to a zoom meeting and it's time.
When the time is right the script will open the zomm link and record your screen for the between the hour you specify.

For now, each time you run the script you need to send the information about the recordings.
In the future you will be able to insert your lessons ones, and the script will be able to record your lesson if it is running.
