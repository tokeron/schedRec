# schedRec

This is a simple python script that automate scheduled recordings of your screen.
This script gets a link to a zoom meeting (can be any link) and time. 
For example: https://example/zoom, 10:30-14:30

If the sctipt is still running when the time is right, it will open the zoom link
and record your screen for the between the hour you specify.

For now, each time you run the script you need to send the information about the recordings.

In the future you will be able to insert your lessons onece,
and the script will be able to record your lesson any time you run it.

This version supports windows 10 only
